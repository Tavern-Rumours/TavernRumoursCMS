# TavernRumoursCMS
The Tavern Rumours CMS is a passion project. As a worldbuilder and writer, I love creating articles and presenting them in an interesting way to interact with readers and players alike. Many articles are interlinked with one another, providing visitors a chance to dive deeper into the world.

The CMS is just the content management system. Hopefully, it will contain all the tools needed to build intricate worlds and universes for people to explore and for builders to create.
